                    Hailey Hastie from The Social Soulpreneur was an avid Twiggs
                    Sudbury customer when she noticed the potential for growth
                    with our social media. Since The Social Soulpreneur has
                    taken over management of our social media accounts, they
                    have dramatically increased our social following from less
                    than 600 to over 3600 real, engaging followers from the
                    Sudbury area. The Social Soulpreneurâ€™s efforts have resulted
                    in daily user-generated content from Twiggs customers and
                    many successful social collaborations with other local
                    companies. TSS is an energetic, creative, confident, and
                    passionate team whose services are a great asset to any
                    business.
